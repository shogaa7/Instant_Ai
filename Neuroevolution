Neuroevolutionor neuro-evolution:
is a form of artificial intelligence that uses evolutionary algorithms to generate artificial neural networks (ANN),
parameters, and rules. It is most commonly applied in artificial life, general game playing and evolutionary robotics.
The main benefit is that neuroevolution can be applied more widely than supervised learning algorithms, which require a syllabus of correct input-output pairs
